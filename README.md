# Minecraft-Bukkit-Chat-Bot-Plugin
I created this bukkit plugin to interact with an AI Chat-Bot API that I have in development

# Command Functions
'/Jenny' command starts a session with the chat-bot
'/jenny end' command ends a session with the chat-bot

While in a chat session, messages are intercepted, and interactions with the chat-bot are presented as whispers to the player

# Additional Features
The plugin also welcomes new players that join the server, with a prompt to /jenny to use the chat-bot

# Future Development
Additional work is being done to train an AI model on Minecraft specific knowledge to provide enriched help on game topics, as well as casually engage the player if desired.
